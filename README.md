# GeoHand
 GeoHand is a React Native mobile application that serves as a tourist guide for France. It allows users to see general information about France, as well as some of the most significant cities in the country. Cities can be viewed on Google Maps, but also in the "Details" section where more information about the city itself can be seen, including the weather forecast for the selected city and a presentation of that city, consisting of a selected number of images in the settings and one video. In the "Landmarks" section, users can see the location of the most significant landmarks in France on Google Maps. By clicking on one of the pins, users can read more information about the landmark. In the "Details" section within the "Landmarks", users can see details about all landmarks and mark one of the landmarks as a favorite. In the "News" section, users can view the most important news from France if there is an internet connection. If there is no connection, and caching is enabled in the settings, users will be shown the last cached news. In the "Settings", users can choose one of the two supported languages (Serbian or English), select the desired number of images to display in the city presentation, or enable news caching. The application works well in both landscape and portrait mode. In the screenshots below, you can see the appearance of the application. Some of the screenshots are duplicated to illustrate that the application supports both languages and both landscape and portrait modes.
